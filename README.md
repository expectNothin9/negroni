# Negroni

The [Negroni](https://negroni.vercel.app/) is a popular Italian cocktail, made of one part gin, one part vermouth rosso, and one part Campari, garnished with orange peel. It is considered an ap√©ritif. A traditionally made Negroni is stirred, not shaken, and built over ice in an old-fashioned or rocks glass and garnished with a slice of orange.

## Next.js with Redux Toolkit and styled-components

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project integrated with [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org) and [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/). How-to please check `create-next-app` examples, [with-redux-toolkit](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-redux-toolkit) and [with-styled-components](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/master/examples/with-styled-components).

In addition, also adopt universal rendering approach from [`with-redux-wrapper`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-redux-wrapper) example.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
